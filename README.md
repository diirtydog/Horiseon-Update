HORISEON UPDATE

Horiseon sought out to update thier website to modern search criteria. In the process of updating thier website I was also able to make it more functional by fixing some small but significant features on the page itself.

The page had no semantic elements and was basically all divs when I first looked into it. I updated the divs to more semantic elements such as section and article. It was also missing the semantic elements of header and footer. 

In the process of updating the divs I also noticed that none of the images contained an alt feature. I updated these deficiencies to make the page more accessible for all visitors while optimizing it for search engines as well.

Another major issue I found was the structure of the css. I had to extensively restructure and label all aspects of the css in order to deliver a prodoct that was free of repetitive elements. This will help with the future development of thier website as our technology advances even further than it is today. It essentially give the next developer a better template to work off of. This also helped me as a developer get a grasp on the importance of proper structure within the css files.

After I made all the necessary corrections I went to the website and extensively tested every aspect of it. I did this to ensure Horiseon has no problems arise in the near future.
