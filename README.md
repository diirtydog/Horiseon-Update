In this challenge I was able to go through and update the html code to more semantic elements. This allows the page to be optimized for multiple search engines.
I also went through the css and was able to consolidate quite a bit of repetitive elements. 
None of the images contained alt tags and I went through and corrected those deficiancies and now they should be more accessible for other visitors to the website.
After each fix I would ensure the fix worked on the live url. I have extensively tested the website and find that it now functions as intended.
